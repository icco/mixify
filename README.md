# Mixify

## Likes DL

Downloads Soundcloud and Hype Machine likes in one go.

Copy the `sample-env` to `.env` and set up the variables to be the usernames you
want to download for.

## Crossfade

Turns a list of Soundcloud Set URL into a crossfaded mix.

Songs must be .wavs so this helps

`ruby script.rb [Soundcloud Set URL]`

ie.  `ruby script.rb https://soundcloud.com/alexbaldwin/sets/mixify-demo`
